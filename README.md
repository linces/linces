🔭 I came from Clipper, which I started to develop in the distant year of 1995, a quick pass through Visual Basic, and then Object Pascal/Delphi, and a couple of languages since then, including PHP, JavaScript, and more recently Dart/Flutter. But I consider Object Pascal/Delphi to be my mother programming language.

Today, I'm currently working on a couple of projects, most of them with Delphi, Firebird, and many other technologies in my daily work. I have some personal projects with Dart/Flutter and some freelance jobs in ReactJS and React Native, as well as PHP with Firebase.

I have worked on a dozen past projects using Clipper, PHP, Delphi, JavaScript, and more.

I am a heavy user of PL/SQL, and by the way, I'm a co-author of the book:

"Delphi 5 with Oracle 8" by Market Books, ISBN-10: 8587393456, ISBN-13: 978-8587393456

It has been many years of passion for software development, today more than ever.
